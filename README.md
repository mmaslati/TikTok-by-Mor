# TikTok by Mor

## Explanation:

This is an assignment in React-Native (Expo) that was givin to me as part of an interview for a React-Native developer.
The assignment:

```

	1. Build a mobile app using react native and typescript
	2. The app is a TikTok clone it should allow the basic functionality which is
		a. Main page - user should be able to slide up/down across videos from other users
			(but not her\his own), each video should show the user name who uploaded it
			and some title
				i. For the sake of the exercise feel free to pull videos from any source and
				put some random/fake title and user name
				ii. The user should be able to like\unlike a video (likes will be saved locally)
		b. Swipe left for the camera and take a video of up to 10 seconds, eace video should
			get a title
				i. For the sake of the exercise just save it on the device
		c. Bonus (Optional): App should show on a calendar view (day\week\month) at
			what days and what hours did the user make his own videos, each video will be
			shown using its title, the calendar view should allow to see the taken video by
			clicking its title. For purposes design you can use the “Anydo” mobile app
			calendar view.

	3. Please note that you should spend up to 3 hours on this task, whatever is done at that
	time is OK.

```

[For this SDK I chose to make use of Expo.](<[https://expo.io/](https://expo.io/)>)
[I've based some of the visual items from the 'tiktok-clone' project by Matheus Castro.](<[https://expo.io/](https://expo.io/)>)

## Requirements for running project:

- Expo.

\*\* Currently, the project does not answer the entirety of the task requirements. It currently reflects code written in a 3 hour timeframe.

Thank you!
